This is an implementation of Brownian Motion (BM) model presented in paper: 

Felsenstein J. Maximum-likelihood estimation of evolutionary trees from continuous characters. Am J Hum Genet. 1973;25: 471â€“492.

Note that currently code uses a lot of optimization to compute a Maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for BM.

This implementation uses a 'batch' mode that allows user to compute MLE for more than one dataset, which provides a powerful tool to compare different evolutionary events in one-go.

Please note that a gsl library is needed when compile this code.

To compile code:
>> make clean
>> make

To run code:
usage: ./bin/MLnoPrior <tree> <motif tab> <num of spe> <num of vectors>
